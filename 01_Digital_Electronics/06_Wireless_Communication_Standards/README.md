### Bluetooth
- Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard used for connecting devices like headphones, keyboards, and mice to computers and smartphones[1].
- The IEEE 802.15.1 standard defines the Bluetooth protocol, which includes different sub-standards for various applications.

### Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)
- Wi-Fi is a longer-range wireless technology standard used for connecting devices to the internet and local networks.
- The IEEE 802.11 standard defines the Wi-Fi protocol, which includes several sub-standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax.
- These sub-standards differ in terms of frequency bands, data rates, and other technical specifications.

### Cellular Standards
- Cellular technologies like LTE and 5G are used for connecting devices to the internet over a cellular network.
- The IEEE 802.16 standard defines the cellular protocols, including LTE (802.16e) and 5G (802.16n).

### Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
- Zigbee is a wireless personal area network (WPAN) standard based on the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, designed for low-power, low-cost wireless sensor networks.

## Network Types

### Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)
- WWANs are designed for citywide, national, or global coverage areas and seamless mobility between access points (base stations).
- Examples include cellular networks (LTE, 5G), GPRS, EDGE, and CDMA2000.

### Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- MANs are designed to provide wireless connectivity over a metropolitan area, typically covering a city or a large campus.
- An example is WiMAX, which is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard.

### Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
- WLANs are used to provide wireless access to local networks and the internet, typically within a range of 150 feet.
- The most common WLAN standard is Wi-Fi, based on the IEEE 802.11 protocol

### Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)
- WPANs are intended for short-range communication between devices, typically controlled by a single person.
- Examples include Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Wireless USB.
