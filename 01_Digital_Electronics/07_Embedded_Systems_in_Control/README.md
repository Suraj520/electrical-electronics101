### When to Use Embedded Systems
Embedded systems are a clear choice for applications that demand high-speed control, custom-made algorithms, and high-level signal processing. They offer flexibility, as they can be used for a range of different kinds of applications, reducing the time and cost of redesigning systems repeatedly or relying on custom designs.

### Examples of Embedded Systems
Embedded controllers can perform a variety of tasks, including:

- Sending and receiving processing signals from the keyboard and touchpad
- Turning the CPU on and off
- Resetting the LAN and GPU
- eSATA, 3G, and 4G toggling
- Bridging between BIOS chips and platform hubs
- Muting audio
- Enabling chargers
- Controlling A20 line access

These controllers can easily be adapted to meet the needs of the host application and the operating conditions of the device.

### Overview of Embedded Control
Embedded control systems involve a microprocessor being used as the controller and located as an integral element, i.e., embedded, within a larger system. These systems are used in a wide range of technologies across various industries, including automobiles, mobile phones, industrial machines, and medical equipment.
