Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control technique that utilizes a process model to predict the future behavior of a controlled system. By solving an optimization problem, MPC determines the control law implicitly, making it a powerful tool in control engineering. Here is a detailed explanation of Model Predictive Control, including its applications, mathematical foundations, and real-world examples:

MPC involves solving an optimization problem at each time step to find the optimal control action that drives the predicted plant output to a desired reference. The control problem typically minimizes a cost function that considers both present and predicted system variables. The optimization problem is solved using an explicit model to predict future process outputs, making MPC a model-based control strategy

### Applications of Model Predictive Control
